"""Unified undershoot detector for persistent temperature deficit conditions.

Detects when the heating system is too weak to reach the setpoint using three modes:

1. Real-time mode: Tracks time below target and thermal debt accumulation during
   normal operation. Triggers Ki boost when system is persistently below setpoint.

2. Cycle mode: Detects chronic approach failures - consecutive cycles where the
   system never reaches setpoint during rise phase. Indicates insufficient
   integral gain.

3. Rate mode: Compares actual heating rate to expected rate from HeatingRateLearner.
   Triggers Ki boost when rate is <60% of expected, with 2 consecutive stalls,
   and duty <85% (system has headroom).

All modes share cumulative multiplier tracking and cooldown enforcement to
prevent runaway integral gain.
